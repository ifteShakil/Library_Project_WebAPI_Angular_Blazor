We have spearheaded the development of a cutting-edge Library Management System, utilizing ASP.NET Core Web API for Back-End, Angular and Blazor for a seamless user experience. This system employs JWT authentication to ensure data security, offering features like book browsing, borrowing, and fine calculation. Admins can efficiently manage users, books, categories, and borrow requests. The system also includes book inspection, online reading, and a request for new books. With its comprehensive capabilities, this project has revolutionized library operations, enhancing accessibility and user satisfaction.
